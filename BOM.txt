trinket pro 5V
	5V chosen for overall system voltage, maybe could have gotten away with 3.3V

battery LiPo rechargable
	The charger/power supply allows a range of voltages coming in, but more importantly charges LiPo batts
	
PowerBoost 500 Charger
	   Trinket can only supply 150mA, Lumenati 8 pack wants 420mA MAX
	   Trinket/Itsy back pack really a 3.3V device, pushing it to do 5.
	   Adafruit LiPo "backpack" can't supply enough current.

lumenti 8 pack
	60mA at brightest x8 = 420mA, so 450-500mA min. for supply.
	If we wanted a larger array, we might need to PB 1000, or maybe have to make our own.
